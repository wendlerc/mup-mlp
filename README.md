# minimum todo

for mup/std for 3 widths (2^7, ..., 2^11) for 6 lrs (2^(-14),..., 2^(-4)) each train on cifar
log
* training error
* validation error
* activation norms / np.abs(activation.mean())?
* gradient norms / np.abs(activation.mean())?

--> training script that gets lr and width as input and logs everything
